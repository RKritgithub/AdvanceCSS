<!-- TASK 1 Problem Statement
Explain the purpose of using the var() function in css. Also you have created two buttons with id named
primaryBtn and secondaryBtn which should be given background colors using the var() function. The color
code for primaryColor is #00b7ff and secondaryColor is #6c757d.-->

<!-- answer
 The var() function in CSS is used to insert the value of a custom property (also known as a CSS variable) into other properties. It allows you to reuse values across your CSS, making it easier to maintain and update the styles. You can define custom properties and then reference them using var(), improving code reusability and flexibility.
